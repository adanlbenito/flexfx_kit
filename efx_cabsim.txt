# FLEXFX STEREO CABSIM Property Interface
#
# Stereo Cabinet Simulator using impulse responses. Impulse responses to upload
# must be stored in a wave file (RIFF/WAV format) and have a sampling frequency
# of 48 kHz. Both mono and stereo source data is supported.  Stereo can also be
# employed by specifying two mono WAV files.
