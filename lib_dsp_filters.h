/** This function implements a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter.
 *  
 *  The function operates on a single sample of input and output data (i.e.
 *  each call to the function processes one sample).
 *
 *  The FIR filter algorithm is based upon a sequence of multiply-accumulate
 *  (MAC) operations. Each filter coefficient ``h[i]`` is multiplied by a state
 *  variable which equals a previous input sample ``x[i]``, or
 *  ``y[n]=x[n]*h[0]+x[n-1]*h[1]+x[n-2]*h[2]+x[n-N+1]*h[N-1]``
 *
 *  The parameter ``filter_coeffs`` points to a coefficient array of size
 *  N = ``num_taps``. The filter coefficients are stored in forward order
 *  (e.g. ``h[0],h[1],h[N-1]``).
 *
 *  The following example shows a five-tap (4th order) FIR filter with samples
 *  and coefficients represented in Q28 fixed-point format.
 *  \code
 *  int32_t filter_coeff[5] = { Q28(0.5),Q(-0.5),Q28(0.0),Q28(-0.5),Q28(0.5) };
 *  int32_t filter_state[4] = { 0, 0, 0, 0 };
 *  int32_t result = lib_dsp_fir( sample, filter_coeff, filter_state, 5, 28 );
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  The FIR algorithm involves multiplication between 32-bit filter
 *  coefficients and 32-bit state data producing a 64-bit result for each
 *  coeffient and state data pair. Multiplication results
 *  are accumulated in 64-bit accumulator with the final result shifted
 *  to the required fixed-point format. Therefore overflow behavior of
 *  the 32-bit multiply operation and truncation behavior from final shifing
 *  of the accumulated multiplication results must be considered.
 *
 *  \param  input_sample    The new sample to be processed.
 *  \param  filter_coeffs   Pointer to FIR coefficients array arranged
 *                          as ``[b0,b1,b2,bN-1]``.
 *  \param  state_data      Pointer to filter state data array of length N.
 *                          Must be initialized at startup to all zeros.
 *  \param  tap_count       Filter tap count (N = ``tap_count`` = filter order + 1).
 *  \param q_format         Fixed point format (i.e. number of fractional bits).
 *  \returns                The resulting filter output sample.
